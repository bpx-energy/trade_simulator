# trade_simulator
DJI trade simulator built in Py_3.8


This is a living model; the intention is to run this simulator as often as neccessary. The initial tf==14 days. During my experiments I have not found a magic tf, however the 14 day period has given me outstanding results.
Also, there may be stock symbols that you would like to add/subtract based on your portfolio or preferences.
